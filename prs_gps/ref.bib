abstract = {NGS is a revolutionising diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. However, its relatively modest application in common diseases is limited by analytical approaches. Instead of variant-level approaches, typical for rare disease or large cohort analyses, contemporary investigation of common polygenic disorders requires the development of tools combining mutational burden and biological impact of a personalised set of mutations into single gene scores. GenePy (https://github.com/UoS-HGIG/GenePy) is a gene score for transforming sequencing data capable of estimating whole-gene pathogenicity on a per-patient basis. GenePy implements known deleteriousness metrics, incorporates allele frequency and individual zygosity information. Individuals harbouring multiple rare highly deleterious mutations accumulate extreme gene scores while the majority of genes usually achieve very low scores. Following correction for gene length, GenePy intuitively prioritises genes within individuals and affords gene/pathway score comparison between groups of individuals. Herein, we generate GenePy scores from whole-exome sequencing data for {\~{}}15,000 genes across a cohort of 508 individuals. We describe score attributes and model behaviour under various biological conditions. We demonstrate proof of concept that GenePy sensitively identifies known causal genes by calculating GenePy scores for NOD2 (an established causal Crohn's Disease gene), in a modest cohort of patients for comparison against controls. This test of GenePy using a positive control gene demonstrates markedly more significant results (p=1.37 x 10-4) compared to the most commonly applied tool for combining common and rare variation. In addition to increasing the biological information content for each variant, the per-gene per-individual nature of GenePy transforms the utility of sequencing data. GenePy scores are intuitive when assessing for individual patients or for comparing between groups. Because GenePy intrinsically reflects pathogenicity at the gene level, this specifically facilitates downstream data integration (e.g. into machine learning, network and topological analyses) with transcriptomic and proteomic data that also report at the gene level.},
